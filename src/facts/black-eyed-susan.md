During a prairie restoration, you can expect Black-eyed Susans to be one of the first flowers to bloom. Blooming from late May to late September, the Black-eyed Susan is a great pollen source for bees in the early summer. Black-eyed Susans attract long-horned, bumble, leafcutter, cuckoo, sweat, and metallic green sweat bees.
