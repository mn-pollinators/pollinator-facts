The monarch butterfly is a common insect that lives in fields and parks where milkweed and native plants are common. Its large size, wide range, and bright orange and black wings make it one of Minnesota's most well-known insects. Each fall, millions of monarchs migrate to wintering grounds west of Mexico City.
